### The Problem statement
Beginner flutists face a significant challenge in accessing accurate musical notes for songs they wish to learn. While digital platforms offer numerous tutorials and audio resources, there is a lack of reliable tools to convert audio into precise flute notation.
### The Solution

Flutune transforms this challenge into an opportunity by offering an intuitive web application that instantly converts any audio file or YouTube song into flute-friendly notes

The Flutune workflow begins with user input through either audio file upload or YouTube URL. Once received, the system processes the audio to extract the melody and identify individual notes. In the backend, noise is removed from the audio. The clean audio is then analyzed to identify frequencies, which are converted into corresponding musical notes. The results are then displayed on screen with an option to download 
 as txt for practice or adding extra notes.

The video demo shows the user journey. The user uploads the audio file or the youtube link. There is a pretty cute loading screen and then we get the flute notes of the song.
